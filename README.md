This app uses Express, MongoDB and Mongoose to keep track of music albums and artists. 
It utilizes RESTful verbs to retrieve, add, edit and remove entries for records and artists. 
If you add the artistId from the appropriate 'artist' resource to a 'record' resource, that artist name will populate in your 'record' resource.
